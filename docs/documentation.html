    <h1>CSE 3341 Project 2: Full Tokenizer - Ben Powell</h1>
    <h3>User Manual</h3>
    <p>
        This project serves as a tokenizer for the Core language, converting a program written in that language to corresponding tokens. The token numbers are sent to the standard output stream for user verification. The Core language cosists of the following legal tokens, all of which are handled and printed in the TokenizerTest class:

        <ul>
            <li>Reserved words (11 reserved words): <br>program, begin, end, int, if, then, else, while, loop, read, write</li>
            <li>Special symbols (19 special symbols): <br>; , = ! [ ] && || ( ) + - * != == < > <= >=</li>
            <li>Integers (unsigned, possibly with leading zeros)</li>
            <li>Identifiers: start with uppercase letter, followed by zero or more uppercase letters and ending with zero or more digits.</li>
        </ul>

        For the purposes of this project, these tokens are numbered 1 through 11 for the reserved words, 12 through 30 for the special symbols, 31 for integer, and 32 for identifier. One other useful token is the EOF token (for end-of-file); let us assume that is token number 33.

        <br><br>

        The code for this project was written in java, and conists of three main files, based on the template provided by Dr Heym. The three neccessary files are : 
        <ul>
            <li>Tokenizer.java - Contains the Tokenizer class which has public methods skipToken and getToken</li>
            <li>TokenizerTest.java - Contains main method. used to run tests on Tokenizer</li>                    
            <li>TokenKind.java - Contains TokenKind inormation used by other classes to differentiate tokens.</li>
        </ul>

    </p>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ul>
            <li>unzip Interpreter.zip and enter the resulting folder</li>
            <li>compile: javac -d bin src/edu/c3341/*.java</li>
            <li>move into bin folder (cd bin)</li>
            <li>run the command specified in Runfile ( java edu/c3341/TokenizerTest ) with the program text as the command line arg</li>
            <li>contact powell.907@osu.edu with any issues</li>
